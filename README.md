## **🚨Course Mission**

Welcome to Object-Oriented Programming! This course is designed to introduce students to the fundamental concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP), a paradigm that uses "objects" – data structures consisting of data fields and methods together with their interactions – to design applications and computer programs.

Students will gain:

* A solid understanding of OOP principles and how they are implemented in a programming language like: Python.
* Practical experience in designing and implementing classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and other OOP concepts.
* Skills to write clean, modular, and robust object-oriented code.

By the end of this course, students will be capable of developing complex software systems using the OOP paradigm.

## **⚡Pre-Requisites**

Before enrolling in this course, students should have:

* Basic programming knowledge in a language such as Python.
* Familiarity with fundamental programming concepts and data structures.

## **🪧Methods of Instruction**

The course will feature in-person labs, and several hands-on programming assignments. All course materials, including slides, will be updated here as the course progresses.
